(BUG) Load player data in a bingo world does not teleport the player out
(BUG) advancement progress is not reset correctly? (MORE INFO NEEDED)
(BUG) kicking a player from a bingo world displays teleportation failed error even though it worked (related to playerdata)
(BUG) fix kickplayers for multiple players (has to do with an issue between loading player data and teleportevent from gamemanager)
(BUG) (TESTING NEEDED) singleplayer teams kick players out of game when it ends, and not always back in again
(BUG) make sure no player data exists after reloading. When a game on a different world took place that now got deleted, the player spawns in the default world, but items aren't restored...
    - Easiest way is probably to restore all player data that still exists after the server is started
