# All available placeholders are listed below under teh placeholders section.
# The way you can use these placeholders is using the prefix bingoreloaded.
# For example %bingoreloaded_team_full% will be replaced by the bingo team name that player is in.
# These placeholders can also be used in the translation file if you wanted.

placeholders:
  # Full team prefix. This should be used most of the time when you want to show the team that the player is in.
  team_full:
    format: "&4[{0}&l{1}&4]&r" # {0}: team_color, {1}: team_name
  # Team color only. This can be used to color other text in the color of the player's team by using similar to a '&'-color prefix.
  team_color:
    format: "{0}" # {0}: team color
  # Team name only. Could be useful if you just want to list the team's name without color or other markup.
  team_name:
    format: "{0}" # {0}: team name
  # Name of the session/world that the player is in.
  session_name:
    format: "({0})" # {0}: session/world name
