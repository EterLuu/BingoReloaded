# Mappings for font characters used by textures as defined by Pack\assets\minecraft\font\default.json. When editing this file, make sure to edit default.json too to match it!
# All integers are meant for horizontal (x-axis) positioning and from left to right, vertical position is done in the font file itself.
# All bit map textures start at the left most space in the texture, and get drawn until the most right placed visible (including alpha=1) pixel in the image,
# texture_end represents the position of the right most placed pixel.
# menu offset is offset relative to the left most pixel of the generic_54 menu texture, and only applies to textures used as full menu background.
# This means to overlap the texture onto each other, we have to move the second texture by -(texture_end + 2), to also account for the empty space after a character is printed.
